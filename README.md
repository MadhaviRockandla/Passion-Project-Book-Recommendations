In Book recommendation system user can give different user inputs based on ratings of book and return recommendation of books. If it is existing user, the recommendations would be based the user earlier inputs.
Will be doing 3 recommendation system Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering and combination of both (Hybrid Filtering).
  # Content-Based Filtering:
In this recommender systems if a person likes a particular book, he or she will also like any book which is like it.

  # Collaborative Filtering: 
Predict the rating or preference that a user would give a book based on past ratings and preferences of other users.

 # Explicit ratings
One way of distinguishing types of user preferences is whether they are explicit or implicit.
Explicit ratings are when the user  explicitly rates the Book.

# Implicit Ratings
For implicit ratings, we don't ask users to give any ratingsâ€”we just observe their behavior.
An example of this is keeping track of what a user clicks.

 # I will be using:
 
Python,
SQLite3,
Pandas,
Jupyter Notebook,
Django,
Streamlit
